          <p>God’s Own ❤️</p>
          <p>My name is Mary Esso, I am passionate about combining my knowledge in health, wellness, technology, and content creation.</p>
          <p>With a strong foundation in Medical Biochemistry and over two years of experience as a Laboratory Scientist, I bring analytical and scientific rigor to all my work.</p>
          <p>As a Yoga Instructor, I guide individuals on their journey to physical and mental well-being. My practice focuses on creating a balanced environment where students can explore the connection between body and mind through breath and movement.</p>
          <p>Additionally, as a Front-end Developer, I build responsive, accessible web applications that adapt seamlessly across devices. I translate UI/UX designs into functional interfaces, write clean and efficient code with modern technologies like React and Next.js, optimize performance, and ensure smooth interaction with back-end systems through APIs.</p>
          <p>Beyond that, I am also a skilled video editor and content creator, producing engaging reels, shorts, and videos in both short-form and long-form formats.</p>
          <p>So yeah, that’s a brief summary about me 😊</p>
